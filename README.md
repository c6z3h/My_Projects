This is a practice on OpenAI's Gym problem Frozen Lake v0, a self-challenge after finishing University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Course (Coursera). Created an agent to traverse a 4x4 maze.

## Project 2: PettingZoo Gym PistonBall_v4
- Referring to https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
- DONE: Cleared disk space, Troubleshoot errors, Read PistonBall environment documentation.
- NEXT STEP:
    1. Briefly read the documentation of (imports) stable_baselines3 and supersuit.
    2. Look through code to understand what is going wrong.
    3. Troubleshoot again.
- Implement, and optimize. Then apply to another problem.
