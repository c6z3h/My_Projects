# Welcome! Here's a list of personal projects.
There's always more to learn, let me know if you have feedback or if you want more generalizable code so you can use some of these functions yourself too! ðŸ˜Š

## Project 1: OpenAI Gym FrozenLake_v0
This is a practice on OpenAI's Gym problem Frozen Lake v0, a self-challenge after finishing University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Course (Coursera). Created an agent to traverse a 4x4 maze.

## Project 2: PettingZoo Gym PistonBall_v4
- Referring to https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
- DONE: Cleared disk space, Troubleshoot errors, Read PistonBall environment documentation.
- NEXT STEP:
    1. Briefly read the documentation of (imports) stable_baselines3 and supersuit.
    2. Look through code to understand what is going wrong.
    3. Troubleshoot again.
- Implement, and optimize. Then apply to another problem.

## Project 3: LUMO$
Automating transfer of logged expenses from Telegram saved messages to Excel using BeautifulSoup and Python.  
- I'm kinda old-school with expense logging, I like to write them in my Telegram Saved Messages, and then put them into PC Excel sheet for calculations.
- The apps out there either look too fancy (and make me want to spend more!?) or do not capture the versatility in the dates (sometimes I like to log 4 FULL weeks into 1 month instead of just 1st to last day of month, which may be 4.5 weeks).
- But... once I manually typed in my expenses and make it seem like I exceeded my budget by $100 ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±. To reduce such human error and also the squinting, here's <mark>âœ¨LUMO$! âœ¨</mark>
