# Welcome! Here's a list of personal projects.
Comments and feedback welcome, let's learn together!  

## Project 1: FrozenLake (OpenAI)
A ```Reinforcement Learning``` agent I developed to solve OpenAI's challenge, description [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).  
  
![Problem Description](https://external-preview.redd.it/xMSGKt4DiSFUocGf0q5RMElmlztOj9wYqecFkOjUq7o.jpg?auto=webp&s=a0f1934ecc0e5c6067790d7b59d829273f513d3a)

## Project 2: PistonBall (PettingZoo)
An attempt at a ```Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning``` problem to coordinate 20 pistons (agents) to push the ball from right to left (of screen) ASAP.

- Referring to https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
- DONE: Cleared disk space, Troubleshoot errors, Read PistonBall environment documentation.
- NEXT STEP:
    1. Briefly read the documentation of (imports) stable_baselines3 and supersuit.
    2. Look through code to understand what is going wrong.
    3. Troubleshoot again.
- Implement, and optimize. Then apply to another problem.

## Project 3: LUMO$
A ```Python script``` for automating transfer of logged expenses from HTML Telegram saved messages to Excel using BeautifulSoup.  
Motivation:
1. Solves the problem of typos when I key in expenses manually.
2. Saves me 30 minutes of error-checking each month. This took 5 hours to develop, so it will be worth it in 10 months!

## Project 4: inspire
A `MERN fullstack web application` to inspire users, through imagery or weblinks. Check it out [here](https://inspire.herokuapp.com/).

Motivation:  
1. Sometimes we are stuck in the same loop of thinking (think: same friends, same family), and having a chance to see a fresh perspective will help to give us new ideas.
