# Welcome! Here's a list of personal projects.
Comments and feedback welcome, let's learn together!  

## Project 1: OpenAI > FrozenLake
A ```Reinforcement Learning``` agent I developed to solve OpenAI's challenge, description [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).  
The challenge involves helping an agent manoeuvre from Point A to B on a 4x4 grid without falling into the potholes.

## Project 2: PettingZoo > PistonBall
An attempt at a ```Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning``` problem to coordinate 20 pistons (agents) to push the ball from right to left (of screen) ASAP.
- Referring to https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
- DONE: Cleared disk space, Troubleshoot errors, Read PistonBall environment documentation.
- NEXT STEP:
    1. Briefly read the documentation of (imports) stable_baselines3 and supersuit.
    2. Look through code to understand what is going wrong.
    3. Troubleshoot again.
- Implement, and optimize. Then apply to another problem.

## Project 3: LUMO$
A ```Python script``` for automating transfer of logged expenses from HTML Telegram saved messages to Excel using BeautifulSoup.  
Motivation:
1. Solves the problem of typos when I key in expenses manually.
2. Saves me 30 minutes of error-checking each month. This took 5 hours to develop, so it will be worth it in 10 months!
