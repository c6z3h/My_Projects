Inspired by randomtarotcard.com , this is an attempt to replicate the randomised nugget of wisdom for users.

The Hagakure is a book of anecdotes that form the basis of The Way of Samurai, or Bushido.
Reading an entire book may be an arduous task, hence the main goal of this web application is to allow users to pick a random piece of wisdom in moments of uncertainty or weakness.

## Implementation Plan
#### Technical Design
- Tabs: Hagakure, and Tao Te Ching
- UI: Cherry Blossom Card, Yin Yang Card
- API: Use original language (eg. Japanese for Hagakure), but link to Google Translate API (or similar)
- Tech Stack: Next.js (learn SSR), TailWindCSS (just because I heard it)

#### v1.0 Implementation
- [ ] Next.js and Vercel App
- [ ] TypeScript implementation
- [ ] 10 cards of Hakagure, JSON file
- [ ] Random card picker algorithm
